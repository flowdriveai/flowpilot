# What is Flowpilot?

Flowpilot is an open source driver assistance system built on top of openpilot, that can run on most windows/linux and android powered machines. It performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Driver Monitoring (DM) for a growing variety of supported car makes, models, and model years maintained by the community.

# Updates:
The main developers have less time to maintain the project now. So expect less support. Most of the stuff should be out there on discord and the wiki. Though, there are some few forks of flowpilot that are more actively maintained, for example, [PhrOOt's](https://github.com/phr00t/flowpilot/wiki/FlowPilot:-FAQ) fork. Although please note that PhrOOt's fork supports only LG G8 devices for now. 

# Running on a Car

For running flowpilot on your car, you need: 

 - A supported machine to run flowpilot i.e. A windows/linux PC or an android phone.
 - A white / grey panda with giraffe or a black/red panda with car harness. 
 - 1x USB-A to USB-A cable for connecting panda to PC and aditionally, an OTG cable is required if connecting panda to phone.
 - One of the [200+ supported cars](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md). The community supports Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, and more. If your car is not supported but has adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, it's likely able to run flowpilot.
 
 For a more detailed overview, see the [wiring and hardware wiki](https://github.com/flowdriveai/flowpilot/wiki/Connecting-to-Car).
 
# Installation:
See the [installation wiki](https://github.com/flowdriveai/flowpilot/wiki/Installation).

# Running With a Virtual Car

It is recommended to develop on a virtual car / simulation before jumping onto testing on a real car. Flowpilot supports CARLA simulation. Optionally, you can use FlowStreamer to test flowpilot with any videogame. For more thorough testing, in addition to simulation, real panda hardware can be put in the loop for a more [thorough testing](https://twitter.com/flowdrive_ai/status/1566680576962478086).
